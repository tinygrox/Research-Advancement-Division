	title = Observe @biome1 and @biome2 from space
	description = We've taken an interest in certain areas on @targetBody. Purely scientifically, of course. We'd like you to investigate @biome1 and @biome2. Don't get too close however, that would be suspici-... harmful for the data we require. So best you do this from orbit. Yes do stay up there, far away, that'll be quite enough. Off you go, shoo.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft into space around @targetBody, taking extra care to make sure your orbit crosses the required areas and perform the required experiments.</color>
    completedMessage = Good, good, that's some excellent intel *ahem* scientific data you've gathered. We'll take it from here!
