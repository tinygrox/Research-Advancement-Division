	title = Analyze the surface at @biome1 and @biome2
	description = One of our resident scientists has had an epiphany. They're saying our experimental data would be improved if we performed the same experiments in multiple locations. Something about causality, correlation, significancy and all that. Don't worry we're not sure either. The point is, our scientist's enthusiasm has brought in more budget from our sponsors. Under condition that we actually do those experiments of course. We can't be bothered with such menial work, naturally. Go and analyze @biome1 and @biome2 from the surface for us.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft onto the surface of @targetBody at @biome1 and @biome2 and perform the required experiments.</color>
    completedMessage = Well, well. It looks like our dear scientist wasn't all up in the cuckoo's nest after all. Don't go telling them this though, next they'll want a promotion, a raise, or some other unwanted complication.
