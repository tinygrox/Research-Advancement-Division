	title = Gather data from the surface at @biome1
	description = We've obtained some good imagery of the surface of @targetBody. Normally this would be none of your concern, but there's something odd with these pictures. Our top labcoats are confused, even the janitor was clueless. There's this smear you see. Or is it a smudge? A speck? Or a blur..? Well nevermind, whatever it is, it's located at @biome1. We want you to go there and get some properly close up and personal info on the area. Get to the surface over there and report back what you find. 
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft onto the surface of @targetBody and perform the required experiments.</color>
    completedMessage = That's odd, the data you've gathered shows nothing out of the ordinary. How perfectly unsatisfying. We're still going to fire that janitor.
