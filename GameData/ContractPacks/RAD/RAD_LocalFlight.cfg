    group = RAD
    genericTitle = Execute a local observation flight
    genericDescription = Execute a local observation flight
	
	title = Execute a local observation flight at @biome1
	description = I'm sure you're aware of the existence of @biome1. We certainly are. What you may not be aware of, is that we think @biome1 is a strange place. More specifically, according to our highly sophisticated **REDACTED** this area has a high potential for **REDACTED**. The only way to be sure however, is for you to send some hardware over there and confirm. 
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Send a craft to the sky above @biome1 and perform the required experiments.</color>
    completedMessage = What wonderful news! These discoveries will surely forever change the **REDACTED** of our great **REDACTED**!
