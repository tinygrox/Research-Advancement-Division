    description = Research Advancement Division is a company funded by some well-off so-called 'philantropic' Kerbals who became impatient with scientific progress being dependent on whichever random direction our rockets are exploding towards. They decided to take matters into their own hands by providing us with funds if we crash things in places they tell us to. And preferably in a specific way too. We're not complaining, we can use the cash.
